## About InfStones

Founded in 2018 with offices across three countries and two continents, InfStones is the world's leading blockchain infrastructure provider. Currently, InfStones provides services to large institutional clients around the globe, including Binance, imToken, Circle and BitGo, supporting thousands of nodes on more than 50 public blockchains through its universal platform.

## Our Architecture

Our validator node only accepts connections from our sentry nodes, thus shielding it from external attacks. Meanwhile, we have a backup node running in tandem that we can use to migrate our validator at any time. Besides, all nodes are protected by our market-tested node operation framework. The framework integrates real-time monitoring, fault warning, disaster recovering, and other automated functions to ensure security, stability, and high availability.
